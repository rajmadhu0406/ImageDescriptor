# ImageDescriptor
A NLP model that takes the combine input of image and text to give the description of the image. 

It uses two algorithms to select the best possible words embeddings, GreedySearch and BeamSearch. The model is trained on flickr_8k dataset and for word embedding, I have used 200 dimension Glove embeddings.
